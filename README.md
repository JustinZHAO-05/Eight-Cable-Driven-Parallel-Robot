Introduction:
The Eight-Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (8-CDPR) is a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) parallel robotic system actuated by eight cables. Unlike traditional rigid-link parallel manipulators, this system utilizes flexible cables to control the position and orientation of the end-effector, offering advantages such as lightweight construction, high payload-to-weight ratio, and large workspace adaptability.

Key Features:
6-DoF Motion Control: The robot can achieve full spatial motion with six degrees of freedom (three translational and three rotational).

Redundant Actuation: The use of eight cables for six degrees of freedom introduces redundancy, allowing optimization of tension distribution to enhance stability and avoid singularities.

Inverse Kinematics (IK): The IK problem involves calculating cable lengths based on a given position and orientation of the end-effector.

Forward Kinematics (FK): Unlike serial robots, FK in CDPRs is complex and typically requires numerical methods such as Newton-Raphson or Levenberg-Marquardt for solution.

Workspace Optimization: The robot's workspace is influenced by cable tension limits, collision constraints, and kinematic redundancy, requiring careful optimization.

This project focuses on developing mathematical models, control strategies, and numerical solutions for motion planning and real-time control of the 8-CDPR system. It can be applied in areas such as industrial automation, aerial robotics, and biomechanics.
